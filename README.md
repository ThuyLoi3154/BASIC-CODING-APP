# BASIC-CODING-APP
This project has been done according to the Python Introduction course requirements

Question 1 (3 points):
Write a program to check the validity of passwords entered by the user. The password validation criteria are:

At least one letter in [a–z]

At least one digit in [0–9]

At least one uppercase letter in [A–Z]

At least one character from [$ # @]

Minimum length: 8 characters

Maximum length: 12 characters

The program should accept a string of passwords separated by semicolons (;) and check whether each one meets the above criteria. Valid passwords should be printed, separated by semicolons.

Example:
Input: ABd1234@1;a F1#;2w3E*;2We3345
Output: ABd1234@1

Question 2 (3 points):
You want to write a love letter to your lover, and the requirement is that it must be private and confidential. Use Caesar Cipher with a user-defined shift value to output the encrypted result.

In cryptography, the Caesar cipher (also known as Caesar’s cipher, shift cipher, Caesar’s code, or Caesar shift) is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet.

Question 3 (3 points):
You probably know the familiar rules when calculating mathematical expressions:

“Multiply and divide before add and subtract. Inside parentheses before outside. Calculate from left to right.”

Write a program to simulate a basic calculator to help compute simple expressions with decimal numbers more quickly.

Question 4 (1 point):
Write a customizable program that allows an instructor to select which exam questions to grade and prints the final score of the student.

Suggested final screen layout:
